# Response Sanitization for AI Assistant

## Overview

The AI assistant now includes automatic sanitization of sensitive information in the final response generation. Instead of sanitizing documents during preprocessing, the system sanitizes responses at the API level to ensure sensitive content is not exposed to users.

## What Gets Sanitized

The system automatically identifies and removes/redacts the following types of sensitive content:

1. **Political Views and Discussions**
   - Political opinions, views, or debates
   - Government criticism or praise
   - Political party discussions

2. **Sex-Related Content**
   - Explicit discussions
   - Innuendos or inappropriate topics
   - Intimate relationship details

3. **Personal Complaints and Relationship Issues**
   - Complaints about partners, spouses, or family members
   - Relationship problems or conflicts
   - Personal grievances

4. **Private Personal Information**
   - Addresses, phone numbers
   - Personal identification details
   - Private contact information

5. **Financial Information**
   - Bank account details
   - Salary information
   - Financial transactions

6. **Other Sensitive Content**
   - Any content that could be considered private or sensitive
   - Personal health information
   - Legal matters

## How It Works

### 1. System Prompt Sanitization
The sanitization instructions are embedded directly in the system prompts used by the AI model:

```python
SANITIZATION REQUIREMENTS:
When providing final answers, ensure you do NOT include any of the following sensitive information:
1. Political views, opinions, or discussions
2. Sex-related content, innuendos, or explicit discussions  
3. Personal complaints about relationships, family, or partners
4. Private personal information (addresses, phone numbers, etc.)
5. Financial information (bank details, salaries, etc.)
6. Any content that could be considered private or sensitive

If you encounter sensitive information in the context or tool results, either:
- Replace it with "[REDACTED]" 
- Skip mentioning it entirely
- Focus on neutral, factual information only

Always provide helpful, safe responses that respect privacy and avoid inappropriate content.
```

### 2. Multi-Level Application
Sanitization is applied at multiple levels:

- **Initial System Prompt**: Applied when the model first receives the question
- **Final Response Prompt**: Applied when synthesizing tool results into final answers
- **Tool Context**: Applied when processing information from various tools

### 3. Redaction Method
Sensitive content is handled in the following ways:

- Replace sensitive content with `[REDACTED]`
- Skip mentioning sensitive information entirely
- Focus on neutral, factual information only

## Implementation Details

### MCP System Prompt Changes

The `MCPClient` class has been enhanced with sanitization instructions in system prompts:

1. **Initial System Prompt**: Added sanitization requirements to the main system prompt
2. **Final Response Prompt**: Added sanitization instructions when synthesizing tool results
3. **Multi-Tool Context**: Sanitization applied across all tool interactions

### Key Files Modified

- `backend/agent/mcp.py`: Added sanitization instructions to system prompts
- `backend/main.py`: Removed separate sanitization function (now integrated into prompts)
- `test_sanitization.py`: Updated to test response sanitization instead of document sanitization

### System Prompt Integration

Sanitization is now seamlessly integrated into the AI model's instructions:

```python
SANITIZATION REQUIREMENTS:
When providing final answers, ensure you do NOT include any of the following sensitive information:
1. Political views, opinions, or discussions
2. Sex-related content, innuendos, or explicit discussions  
3. Personal complaints about relationships, family, or partners
4. Private personal information (addresses, phone numbers, etc.)
5. Financial information (bank details, salaries, etc.)
6. Any content that could be considered private or sensitive

If you encounter sensitive information in the context or tool results, either:
- Replace it with "[REDACTED]" 
- Skip mentioning it entirely
- Focus on neutral, factual information only

Always provide helpful, safe responses that respect privacy and avoid inappropriate content.
```

## Logging and Monitoring

The system provides detailed logging about response generation:

```
ðŸ¤” Processing question: What did John say about the meeting?
ðŸ“¤ Sending combined context to model
âœ… MCP completed successfully
âœ… Successfully processed question using MCP_WITH_COMBINED_CONTEXT
```

Sanitization is now transparent to the user - sensitive content is automatically filtered out during response generation without additional API calls.

## Testing

You can test the response sanitization functionality using the provided test script:

```bash
# Set your Google API key
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-api-key"

# Run the test
python test_sanitization.py
```

The test script includes examples of:
- Political discussions in responses
- Inappropriate content in responses
- Personal complaints in responses
- Neutral business content in responses

## Benefits

1. **Privacy Protection**: Ensures sensitive personal information is not exposed in AI responses
2. **Compliance**: Helps meet privacy and data protection requirements
3. **Efficiency**: No additional API calls needed - sanitization is built into the model's instructions
4. **Transparency**: Sanitization is seamless and transparent to users
5. **Consistency**: Applied consistently across all response types (direct answers, tool results, etc.)

## Configuration

The sanitization is enabled by default and cannot be disabled, as it's a critical privacy feature. The system is designed to be conservative - it's better to redact content that might be sensitive than to accidentally include sensitive information.

The sanitization instructions are embedded in the system prompts and are applied automatically to all responses.

## Example

**User Question:**
```
What did John say about the meeting and his personal life?
```

**AI Response (with sanitization):**
```
Based on the available information, John mentioned that the meeting is scheduled for tomorrow at 3 PM to discuss the quarterly budget. [REDACTED] regarding other topics.

The meeting details are confirmed and ready to proceed as planned.
```

The AI automatically redacted sensitive personal information while preserving the relevant business information about the meeting.
