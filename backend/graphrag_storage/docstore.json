A discussion ensues comparing Northern and Southern Chinese noodles, with Eric expressing a preference for Northern noodles due to their texture.  \u618b\u54e5 defends Su-style red soup noodles as unique and encourages others to try them.  There's also mention of a \"sauce-flavored latte\" being available.\n\n* **Travel and Activities:** \u618b\u54e5 mentions his arrival in Zhangjiagang, a city near Shanghai and Suzhou.  He invites the group to visit.  He also inquires about Burning Man and expresses interest in attending.  He talks about getting a massage and shares a photo of what appears to be his balcony view.  \u6bb5\u795e mentions seeing a red Porsche 911 driven by a woman and suggests introducing her to \u618b\u54e5.\n\n* **Gaming:** \u51ef\u795e mentions finishing a game (likely the same one wxid_3810948111312 was playing earlier) and its hidden ending.\n\n---\n\nThe conversation is about \u618b\u54e5 getting a massage.\n\nSummary:\n\n\u4e00\u53f7\u51ef\u7c89 mentioned getting a massage. \u618b\u54e5 stated a price of 92 (presumably for a massage) and then later shared an image of a massage deal for 50.

Eric explains that \"\u91ce\u6218\" (mentioned by \u6bb5\u795e) means playing casual basketball with strangers.  \u51ef\u795e jokes that someone else might have used \u618b\u54e5's phone number. ZZN later suggests \u618b\u54e5 might have given someone his secondary SIM card.

ZZN mentions practicing basketball without the others. Later, the group discusses playing basketball, with \u51ef\u795e lamenting the skill level of pick-up game players compared to \"\u618b\u54e5,\" whom they consider very skilled. They humorously mention \u618b\u54e5 \"dominating\"\u8def\u4eba (passersby/random opponents).\n\n**Video Game:**\n\nThe conversation also revolves around a video game, with \u6bb5\u795e talking about their progress and boss battles.  They mention defeating \u9ec4\u7709 and a \"red-butted monkey,\" attributing their success to leveling up.

They're following the vote counts in key states, particularly Michigan, Pennsylvania (PA), Georgia (GA), and Arizona.  They speculate on the implications of a Trump win, including its effect on interest rates and the stock market, specifically mentioning ZZN's company's ties to the Democratic party. They also discuss the historical precedent of presidents returning to the White House after losing a previous election. Later, the conversation shifts slightly to finding a handyman, but this is largely off-topic.\n\n**Summary of meaningful exchanges:**\n\n* **Initial question:** @\u96f6\u53f7\u51ef\u7c89-\u5934\u53f7\u618b\u7c89-\u5927\u5e9f\u7269\u2005\u4f60\u4fe9\u5230\u5e95\u591a\u5c11 (What are your weights - this is off-topic and should be removed in final cleaning)\n* **Election discussion:** The group follows the election results, with comments about Trump potentially winning, and the implications for interest rates and ZZN's company.  They also discuss historical precedents for a president returning to office.\n* **Handyman request:** ZZN asks for handyman recommendations. \u6bb5\u795e jokingly suggests \u51ef\u795e, who declines, saying he learns from YouTube.

ZZN clarifies that they intend to fill the holes before painting but are unsure if the filled area is still usable for the curtain rod. \u51ef\u795e questions what the intended use is and encourages ZZN to try DIY repairs. \u6bb5\u795e suggests checking if the curtain rod is anchored to a stud. ZZN explains the issue is due to a lack of a stud at the midpoint and possibly the weight of the curtains.\n\n**Internet Provider:**\n\nZZN asks if anyone in the group uses Ziply Fiber and if there are any drawbacks.  \u6bb5\u795e, a Ziply user, offers a referral link and assures ZZN there are no issues and they don't need to use Ziply's devices.

KaiShen mentions spending $2500 on a December flight with premium select on Delta.  There's a brief, unresolved discussion about when someone is traveling.\n\n**Layoffs:**  ZZN, BieGe, and KaiShen discuss layoffs at Meta/Facebook. Meta is laying off 5% due to performance issues. BieGe explains some employees abused leave policies (FMLA) to delay being fired, but Meta is now closing that loophole.  KaiShen notes Microsoft is becoming more like Amazon in its performance management, pressuring managers to identify low performers.  The group speculates about job security and the difficulty of finding new jobs in the current market. KaiShen expresses interest in moving to Google.\n\nThere's a side conversation about a person (\"B\u795e\") who enjoys playing a character named \"White Tiger\" in a game (likely Dota 2, given the context).

He suggests Wednesday as the best day due to a Friday morning meeting. Later, Kai says his meeting was canceled. Duan asks about it being a team-building event, and Bie raises the concern about parking. Kai clarifies that taking a day off would be best and suggests Wednesday.\n\n**Furniture:** Eric bought a Herman Miller chair and feels overcharged. He's considering returning it and upgrading.  He mentions using Temu and potentially \"all in\" on PDD (Pinduoduo). Jason shares his negative experience with PDD.  Duan asks about Eric's furniture progress and when he'll place an order, to which Eric replies he's finalizing it, but the TikTok ban is making him reconsider.  Duan jokes about Eric and B sharing furniture.\n\n**TikTok Ban:** The conversation turns to the potential TikTok ban in the US.  Eric shares news and images about potential protests. There is a discussion on whether a ban would benefit other platforms like Reels, the political implications, and whether TikTok users would migrate.  Kai suggests buying Meta stock as a hedge. The conversation speculates about what concessions China might offer if the US lifts the ban.  Eric believes the situation will force users to migrate and creators to Reels, even if the user experience isn't comparable.\n\nThis conversation segment contains substantial discussion and should not be filtered out.\n\n---\n\nThe main topic is waiting in a long checkout line, potentially for Zhou Shen concert tickets.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1946, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dd9d467d-d328-4dbb-a950-6ffb7fc1deb2": {"__data__": {"id_": "dd9d467d-d328-4dbb-a950-6ffb7fc1deb2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "google_sheets", "document_id": 28, "content_length": 5356, "original_length": 10530, "processed_length": 5356, "compression_ratio": 0.508641975308642, "preprocessed": true}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "db883008-1f61-401e-8b88-cabba7208151", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "google_sheets", "document_id": 28, "content_length": 5356, "original_length": 10530, "processed_length": 5356, "compression_ratio": 0.508641975308642, "preprocessed": true}, "hash": "c70b8bea6420a5d300ccd4a4c561634523460807d3cec5421e64f64daaced02d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8b43d18c-c183-481c-abb2-ee506f6d1df5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source": "google_sheets", "document_id": 28, "content_length": 5356, "original_length": 10530, "processed_length": 5356, "compression_ratio": 0.508641975308642, "preprocessed": true}, "hash": "2d7f5140708e3e9bed0ef6a4910faf1755a87a0a3ce88d229a83590d072509db", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ab333222-c25b-4b2c-bc8b-b08a3f48329f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7cf0721f7c30b06ae1f225cecb93ce002308e2a382f3f045d9d2b4c9d3584536", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "This conversation segment contains substantial discussion and should not be filtered out.\n\n---\n\nThe main topic is waiting in a long checkout line, potentially for Zhou Shen concert tickets.\n\nSummarized:\n\n@\u96f6\u53f7\u51ef\u7c89-\u5934\u53f7\u618b\u7c89-\u5927\u5e9f\u7269 mentioned a long checkout line. \u6bb5\u795e initially disagreed, saying it was fast, but then agreed it was long.

Later, Kai expresses being tired and not wanting to work. Eric and WuFei agree with his sentiment.\n* **Stock Discussion:** ZZN mentions Meta stock rising, leading to a discussion about stock prices. DuanShen jokes about having found an old Meta investment that would make him rich, allowing him to quit his job. He later admits this was a dream.\n* **Valentine's Day:** DuanShen asks about Friday plans, and BieGe points out it's Valentine's Day.  DuanShen then realizes he hasn't made any plans. Jason suggests sending flowers.\n* **Kai's Sickness and Game Opening:** Kai mentions he has been sick and vomiting.  Later, DuanShen shares a picture of a successful game opening, which Kai calls him lucky for.  BieGe also shares a picture of a game item, asking if it is good. DuanShen expresses interest in it.\n\nThis conversation segment contains a mix of significant events (Kai's clutch game performance, stock discussion) and casual chatter.

Yubin suggests checking the furnace connections, pointing out that the old thermostat only needed two wires while the new one requires three for additional voltage, with C being insufficient. Eric checks the furnace and finds two sets of R wires, believing one is for the AC.  He's having trouble figuring out the correct wiring and mentions following a YouTube tutorial. Yubin recommends further online research as they don't recall the specifics.\n\n---\n\nYubin is having trouble installing a smart thermostat due to a Honeywell-specific circuit board.

Duan Shen thinks negotiating a lower price might be difficult.\n\n---\n\nThe main topic is discussing the possibility of someone (likely \u51ef\u795e/Kai) buying a house, with the primary reason for not pursuing it being financial constraints.\n\nSummarized Discussion:\n\n@\u708e\u9f99\u4fa0\u5ba2 asked if they were considering something (likely buying a house).\n\n\u51ef\u795e (Kai) responded that they have no money. \u6bb5\u795e (Duan) added that they haven't even gotten a pre-approval letter and just spent a lot of money replacing a refrigerator. ZZN pointed out that Kai was looking at 3.5 million dollar houses last year, implying a significant price drop in their current search. \u6bb5\u795e attributed this to the stock market decline.  Later, \u51ef\u795e clarified they were just looking and realized they couldn't afford it.\n\n---\n\n\u6bb5\u795e asked if there is validation. \u618b\u54e5 confirmed there is. ZZN asked if there is afternoon basketball, referencing a previous message (likely an image related to basketball) and then asking if anyone is playing basketball in the morning.  \u618b\u54e5 then asks if a full team is required to play.\n\nSummary:\n\n* **Question 1:** Is there validation?\n* **Answer 1:** Yes.\n* **Question 2 (ZZN, referencing a previous message likely about basketball):**  Is there afternoon basketball? Is anyone playing basketball in the morning?\n* **Question 3 (\u618b\u54e5):** Is a full team required to play?\n\n---\n\nThe main topic is coordinating a meeting/lunch, likely in a workplace setting.\n\nSummary:\n\nThe group is coordinating a meeting/lunch.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1600, "end_char_idx": 3526, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b935f31c-2eba-44f0-9328-0a0ad9d478ea": {"__data__": {"id_": "b935f31c-2eba-44f0-9328-0a0ad9d478ea", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "google_sheets", "document_id": 42, "content_length": 8081, "original_length": 10572, "processed_length": 8081, "compression_ratio": 0.7643776012107454, "preprocessed": true}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "291dce2f-29de-43a5-a113-53b1a74a99d2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "google_sheets", "document_id": 42, "content_length": 8081, "original_length": 10572, "processed_length": 8081, "compression_ratio": 0.7643776012107454, "preprocessed": true}, "hash": "d0f3aef1abc38fe57679d791387aa456a1d10175cb43d32f021d8a3dbc031619", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "150bc7c3-5ed2-4a52-83aa-b44cea561244", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source": "google_sheets", "document_id": 42, "content_length": 8081, "original_length": 10572, "processed_length": 8081, "compression_ratio": 0.7643776012107454, "preprocessed": true}, "hash": "f1fe8685153eda81c468f6bb320e00eef497ca1c0a78de3c9cc42014ac5f55ae", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0f2fd8db-5bf5-449c-9eea-4a06376298c4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3e8e906104e2654e80c276d62a319c3f66421319f5722b66f3b55e9d37592f89", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "* **Question 3 (\u618b\u54e5):** Is a full team required to play?\n\n---\n\nThe main topic is coordinating a meeting/lunch, likely in a workplace setting.\n\nSummary:\n\nThe group is coordinating a meeting/lunch.  \u6bb5\u795e initially states it will take 25 minutes to arrive and expresses concern about the distance. \u9a6c\u68da says they are in Seattle and will head over, later confirming their arrival and entry, even having to persuade someone to be admitted. \u51ef\u795e mentions being delayed by a meeting but will join after dropping off their wife at her company. \u618b\u54e5 is en route.  \u6bb5\u795e also confirms their arrival.

Initially, the location is unclear. ZZN complains that the Redmond center isn't an option.  \u9a6c\u68da asks for a location.  \u51ef\u795e says they'll come if enough people are going and the activity/location is clarified. \u618b\u54e5 suggests either \u4f55\u6bd4's house or playing poker at Microsoft. \u9a6c\u68da confirms they're ready and waiting for \u618b\u54e5.\n\n---\n\n\u618b\u54e5 is organizing something and asking who is going.  \u9a6c\u68da says he can go and can drive, but then mentions he needs to do something else first (\"\u515c\u4e00\u5708\" - take a spin/short trip) which implies he might be late or unavailable initially.\n\n---\n\nThe segment \"@\u4f59\u9707\u8df5\u8e0f\u5171\u751f\u5565\u65f6\u51fa\" translates to \"When will Aftershock/Trample Symbiosis be released?\"  This is a direct question about the release date of something called \"Aftershock/Trample Symbiosis.\"  There's no casual chatter, off-topic comments, or simple acknowledgments.\n\nSummarized:  The user is asking when \"Aftershock/Trample Symbiosis\" will be released.\n\n---\n\nZZN is busy and can't immediately participate in the planned activity, suggesting the others proceed without them.

DuanShen says they will wait for others to get home.  MaPeng is busy.  Biege expresses frustration that no one is available.  MaPeng suggests planning a day in advance.  KaiShen thought the activity was at 3 pm and asks about Hebi, who was supposed to participate.  Biege confirms and wonders where Hebi is.

Eric is not playing.\n\n---\n\n\u618b\u54e5 offered to share two activities. Eric and \u51ef\u795e reacted with \"\u63a5\u9f99\" (which likely means joining or signing up), and Eric added \"\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6211\u53ef\" (meaning something like \"I can do this\" or \"I'm in\").  \u618b\u54e5 then shared a mini-program.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3398, "end_char_idx": 5098, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0964f0b0-52eb-49bf-888b-b07aac29ac29": {"__data__": {"id_": "0964f0b0-52eb-49bf-888b-b07aac29ac29", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "google_sheets", "document_id": 51, "content_length": 9548, "original_length": 10868, "processed_length": 9548, "compression_ratio": 0.8785425101214575, "preprocessed": true}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "05e9f303-0003-42c9-bc03-faefcec8a552", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "google_sheets", "document_id": 51, "content_length": 9548, "original_length": 10868, "processed_length": 9548, "compression_ratio": 0.8785425101214575, "preprocessed": true}, "hash": "e7c84c7bdc30912672f38e87128f476e55165704591a0c671f71a73da2392099", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "90f9ea9d-cd16-4869-a2f6-f9afb30a2f6e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source": "google_sheets", "document_id": 51, "content_length": 9548, "original_length": 10868, "processed_length": 9548, "compression_ratio": 0.8785425101214575, "preprocessed": true}, "hash": "8eeff99db69bd3108fb681a96fff83246144e88d654a25d981f0d31b0b5595e1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "17f04991-8b46-4abc-9435-07ca3a29ff78", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "aaf936e2e57f33be72759bb997fe5363d84366b67bfc78b81ee933287184b274", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "\u618b\u54e5 then shared a mini-program.\n\nSummary: \u618b\u54e5 shared two activities via a mini-program. Eric and \u51ef\u795e expressed interest in participating.\n\n---\n\n\u618b\u54e5 is considering buying a pre-built MSI ZS2 computer from Costco. He's unsure because the CPU is a 9900 (not the 9800X3D he prefers) and it has a B650 motherboard which others think is not ideal. He's also not thrilled with the 5070ti graphics card, but is tempted by the immediate availability at Costco. A 5080 configuration is available, but with a worse CPU and higher price.  Others discuss the trade-offs of the B650 motherboard (USB 4.0, PCIe5) and the perceived benefits of a pre-built system (claimed quiet operation) versus building one's own.  Final argues pre-built systems offer no performance advantages. The group also briefly discusses the difference between a 5070ti and 5080 graphics card.\n\n---\n\nFinal is having trouble buying a 5090 graphics card, specifically a Founder's Edition (public version), because it's the only one that fits in his case.  Biege suggests he buy a new case, or change his resolution to 800x600 as a workaround.  Others suggest he find a friend at Nvidia to get a Founder's Edition, but Final says they can't find one either. He's considering waiting until he returns to his home country to purchase one from Costco.  Biege states that 5090s are available online, and that his last computer build only cost 1k, while Final points out that graphics cards alone now cost 1k.  The conversation also involves some banter about Biege's 911 and the rising cost of KTV.\n\n---\n\nThe conversation revolves around KTV prices and jokingly escalates to innuendo about other services and locations.  \"Final\" (presumably Xu Jianing) defends themselves against implications of soliciting or providing illicit services.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nFinallz mentioned KTV prices are now 3500.

Ma Peng also claimed to visit legitimate places, explaining they go to high-end apartments to deliver DoorDash. Liu Kun and \"Final\" continue to make innuendos, with \"Final\" asserting they stick to \"legitimate\" activities. Jason interjects with seemingly off-topic comments about \"B650 being enough\".  Finally, Final posts a picture without explanation.\n\nWhile the core thread of the conversation revolves around \"Final\" defending against accusations of illicit behavior, much of it is veiled in innuendo and banter. The concluding picture adds no clarity. While not entirely noise, the conversation is primarily teasing and joking.  Almost all useful information could be condensed to \"Final\" saying KTVs now cost 3500, and defending themself against jokes about non-legitimate activities.

Jason shares a different room code (\"153038\") for an NLHE game.  There's still confusion as some see only one person (\"Final\") or two (\"\u51ef\u795e\") in the room.

The conversation shifts to food, with \u9a6c\u68da mentioning McDonald's and \u51ef\u795e talking about eating chicken.  \u9a6c\u68da then tries to meet up with Final, who is at work.  They joke about sniping Final at work. Final then suggests \u9a6c\u68da make videos demonstrating their gaming skills. \u9a6c\u68da deflects, pointing out their lower skill level.  Final suggests a specific map (\"bellevue\u9ad8\u7ea7\u516c\u5bd3\"), which \u9a6c\u68da claims to have \"quit.\"  \u9a6c\u68da then shares a picture related to work and mentions taking a sick day.  \u5218\u5764 asks about the Indian colleagues in the picture.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1764, "end_char_idx": 3527, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "926715a3-180e-4207-bf0d-fbbabb188a28": {"__data__": {"id_": "926715a3-180e-4207-bf0d-fbbabb188a28", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "google_sheets", "document_id": 55, "content_length": 9823, "original_length": 10753, "processed_length": 9823, "compression_ratio": 0.913512508137264, "preprocessed": true}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9d17af3c-3032-4473-81a0-b42b17907715", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "google_sheets", "document_id": 55, "content_length": 9823, "original_length": 10753, "processed_length": 9823, "compression_ratio": 0.913512508137264, "preprocessed": true}, "hash": "727a396cdecc51d2e1931caf498e1b1b989df4456f8bbcb6ed604527ddd0abdc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fb51ca88-df34-4476-8b46-677b9be7ddb8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source": "google_sheets", "document_id": 55, "content_length": 9823, "original_length": 10753, "processed_length": 9823, "compression_ratio": 0.913512508137264, "preprocessed": true}, "hash": "f7183a2c9bc3861930dec487ddb7aa31de7009e1d1f82ed151d79fc09f6e32e7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5a59cfc1-b2ab-4dc8-8098-8bed252f64a6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "dab048cf4e22043acaa6ce3080e103dd33b14f145adb7ca2ab9807d635953e47", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "\u9a6c\u68da then shares a picture related to work and mentions taking a sick day.  \u5218\u5764 asks about the Indian colleagues in the picture.  \u9a6c\u68da clarifies they are in a customer support channel.  Eric asks about Amazon's return-to-office policy (RTO5).\n\n---\n\nThe main topic is a discussion about different teams (\"Brass,\" \"Bindles\") within a company (possibly Amazon, due to the mention of \"RTO5\"), their responsibilities, and some observations about their work culture.\n\nSummary:\n\nIn response to the question \"@\u8bb8\u5609\u5b81  \u9a6c\u68da\u662f\u7ba1Brass\u7684\u5417\" (Is Ma Peng in charge of Brass?), \u9a6c\u68da clarifies the relationship between the teams: \"brass is data plane, I am bindles, control plane.

Regarding a previous comment about RTO5, \u9a6c\u68da observes, \"After RTO became 5, no one actually checks anymore.\"  Later, \u9a6c\u68da expresses envy for Brass's workload (\"brass did KTLO tasks for a year\") and comments on their social habits (\"brass's three people drink every night until late\").

They clarified that it's not related to managed NAT and provided a link to AWS tagging best practices.  The group then briefly discussed the prevalence of Amazon connections within the group, with several members identifying as Prime members.  A separate discussion about a basketball player moving to Portland followed.\n\n---\n\nThe topic is coordinating taking out the trash.\n\nSummary:\n\nSomeone asked the group when they were ready.  \u51ef\u795e said they were taking out the trash and would be ready shortly.

Since \u618b\u54e5's response is empty, it doesn't add to the conversation.\n\nFILTER_OUT\n\n---\n\nThe conversation seems to revolve around playing a game (possibly an online game), but the exact game is unclear.  \"\u6253\u4ec0\u4e48\" translates to \"play what?\". The later suggestion of \"\u6253\u70ae\" (a vulgar term) likely indicates either a crude joke or misinterpretation.  The final comments from \u9a6c\u68da express impatience for the game to start.\n\n**Summarized:**\n\nSomeone asked Jason if he was ready (\u597d\u4e86\u6ca1).  Jason and \u9a6c\u68da both asked \"Play what?\" (\u6253\u4ec0\u4e48). Final suggested \"\u6253\u70ae\".  \u9a6c\u68da then expressed impatience, urging them to start playing.\n\nWhile there's a bit of substance here (trying to decide what to play), the vulgarity and lack of clarity around the topic make it borderline for filtering.  However, given the clear question and responses surrounding game choice, it's not pure noise.  Therefore, I will *not* return \"FILTER_OUT\".\n\n---\n\nThe main topic is Duan Shen's birthday coinciding with a potential game 7 of the NBA finals, and the possibility of getting Yang HanSen's autograph.\n\nSummary:\n\nDuan Shen's birthday is on June 26th.  Eric pointed out that Yang HanSen (a basketball player presumed to be playing in the NBA) is also from China, and if the Trail Blazers (Yang HanSen's presumed team) make it to game 7 of the finals, it might coincide with Duan Shen's birthday.

They suggest securing A hall is crucial but acknowledge the possibility of being counter-attacked. Final recommends a delayed rush rather than an immediate one. \u6bb5\u795e suggests a default regrouping and detonation strategy, modifying the grenade count depending on whether they rush.  \u618b\u54e5 proposes a detailed plan involving an A flash to help Final enter A hall first, followed by the rest of the team executing a default strategy while anticipating smoke and other countermeasures, and then detonating grenades at a later time.  Later, the conversation shifts to comparing players (ropz, \u618b\u54e5) and teams (targa vs. gt3rs, Meta vs. Team Vitality).\n\n---\n\n\u6bb5\u795e is speculating that the CS2 trick shown in Jason's\u6296\u97f3 video (linked) might be achieved using a spray paint mod/hack.

Jason asks about \u618b\u54e5's new computer. \u618b\u54e5 later describes a hand where AA and KK went all-in pre-flop and ran twice, each producing a king. He compares the timing to his own play.  \u9a6c\u68da offers a philosophy on winning at poker, suggesting focusing on probability for long-term gains or luck for immediate wins.\n\n---\n\nThe main topic is coordinating a gathering, likely for an online poker game.\n\nSummary:\n\nA message was sent to everyone to \"go.\"  Several people acknowledged (\"g\", \"go\", \"\u6765\").", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1818, "end_char_idx": 3580, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f8870f96-ca2a-4e7e-91dd-0a540670adca": {"__data__": {"id_": "f8870f96-ca2a-4e7e-91dd-0a540670adca", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "google_sheets", "document_id": 56, "content_length": 9053, "original_length": 11209, "processed_length": 9053, "compression_ratio": 0.8076545632973503, "preprocessed": true}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "27bc2b48-b792-49a9-ad47-a0f64d520ccb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "google_sheets", "document_id": 56, "content_length": 9053, "original_length": 11209, "processed_length": 9053, "compression_ratio": 0.8076545632973503, "preprocessed": true}, "hash": "9fc6a98ea2917028cbe7caba270210c172140d14167b8994492fbbd73b7ce8a0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "21b4c4e7-826b-4867-9957-b1a2fba59cde", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source": "google_sheets", "document_id": 56, "content_length": 9053, "original_length": 11209, "processed_length": 9053, "compression_ratio": 0.8076545632973503, "preprocessed": true}, "hash": "2e79bf41662175e0559ca5021c5e2ce0e8e6af83d3ebe2022856e0129685a240", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7426c9f5-dae6-4623-9751-2f65b803d1d4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5a5f84f217f230cdf95a096f5a2b889a5fcd86168f8479e998c767dd532ad725", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "---\n\nThe main topic is coordinating a gathering, likely for an online poker game.\n\nSummary:\n\nA message was sent to everyone to \"go.\"  Several people acknowledged (\"g\", \"go\", \"\u6765\").  \u6bb5\u795e indicated they would be late. \u9a6c\u68da asked where everyone was.

Final seems frustrated about their play, stating they \"didn't play J8 yesterday\" and calling the hand \"a J8\". Others share their bad beats, focusing on \"\u5c0f\u7626\u54e5\" (Little Skinny Bro) who seems to have won several hands with strong river cards. \u9a6c\u68da (Ma Peng) describes going all-in multiple times and nearly recovering their losses.  The conversation turns to the possibility of future online and offline games.  There's some playful banter about who is the best player and who makes the most all-in moves.  Organizing an offline game proves difficult due to scheduling conflicts.\n\n---\n\nJason's potential employment at Amazon (\u4e9a\u9ebb) is being discussed.

Jason questions this. \u51ef\u795e confirms, attributing it to Finallz's poor sniper play and ambition to take someone else's (\u9e1f\u5c45king's) position. Jason mentions their struggles with the AK and later the sniper rifle. \u51ef\u795e suggests competing with \u618b\u54e5 for the sniper role.

While the initial exchange about frequency and the age discussion are somewhat related, the final part about the website changes the tone completely. Given the inappropriate turn, it's best to filter this segment out.\n\n**FILTER_OUT**\n\n---\n\nLiu Kun asked where Xiaopangge (presumably a nickname) was. Jason replied that he was at the gym. Biege then asked when he would be finished.\n\nThe main discussion revolves around Xiaopangge's whereabouts and when he will be available.  The summarized conversation is:\n\n**Liu Kun:** Where is Xiaopangge?\n**Jason:** He's at the gym.\n**Biege:** When will he be done? \n\n---\n\nSomeone (@\u4e0d\u53c2\u52a011pm\u4ee5\u540e\u6d3b\u52a8) stated they won't participate in activities after 11 pm.

They further elaborate that they shouldn't \"fail immediately\" like in a shooting game, presumably connecting the cardio to needing stamina or practice for the unnamed activity.  \"\u9a6c\u68da\" is confused and asks \"\u5565\u610f\u601d\" (what does that mean?).  It seems the initial prompt for activity organization was left blank.\n\nSummarized:\n\nA user suggested organizing an activity.  Another user (\"\u6bb5\u795e\") mentioned practicing before a real-world application next week, seemingly related to a previous comment about cardio exercise, and explained they shouldn't fail immediately as if in a shooting game. Another user (\"\u9a6c\u68da\") expressed confusion about the meaning.  The initial suggestion for an activity was empty.\n\n---\n\nThe main topic is planning a basketball game.\n\nSummary:\n\nEric proposes playing basketball. ZZN initially agrees but later goes to the emergency room because their child was sick.  The next day, ZZN asks if the game is still on.  ZZN, Eric, and Kaishen initially plan to play, but Kaishen cancels due to chores before leaving for a trip. Biege also cancels to take their child to Bainbridge. Eric and ZZN decide to shoot hoops together instead. Eric suggests several locations and then confirms he is heading out.\n\n---\n\nThis translates to \"@Not participating in activities after 11 pm\".

The second part seems unrelated and like a separate, casual conversation.  The timestamps suggest a delay between the initial question and ZZN asking \"Where did you go?\".

Duan Shen mentioned feeling like their four cards were beat by a two-outer. Bie Ge commented that KK couldn't go all in but 99 could, aiming to slow play for value and capitalize on a potential straight flush. Kai Shen pointed out this analysis is hindsight-biased, as it relies on knowing the 7 and 8 of hearts.  Kai Shen also questioned the pre-flop pot size of 12k, suggesting it's too low and that KK and 99 should have 3-bet pre-flop in a 1000/2000 blind game. Kai Shen analyzed 99's perspective, stating they would primarily consider AA, KK, or AK, and aim to extract value from those hands, not worrying much about a straight flush draw. Duan Shen jokingly expressed feeling intimidated by the group's poker knowledge. Kai Shen clarified he's a beginner.  The conversation then shifts to when Kai Shen is returning home (August).\n\n---\n\nDuan Shen told Jason to stop what he was doing and register a WeChat account to make a purchase (presumably for the \"final\" mentioned).

Jason later clarified that he was referring to a Native American.  \u6bb5\u795e confirmed they would join the group after they are finished (presumably with whatever \u618b\u54e5 is queuing for).  \u6bb5\u795e also questioned Jason's use of \"Indian\" vs. \"Native American.\"\n\n---\n\nThe initial message \"@50%\u9e3d\u4efb\u4f55\u6d3b\u52a8\" suggests a 50% chance of flaking on any planned activity.  Jason seems to agree (\"\u6709\u7684\") and then makes derogatory comments about someone, seemingly unrelated to the initial topic. \u618b\u54e5 doesn't contribute anything substantial.\n\nSince the core discussion about flaking is overshadowed by off-topic insults and meaningless acknowledgments, the meaningful conversation is minimal. Thus, the response is:\n\nFILTER_OUT\n\n---\n\nJason initially declines an invitation due to not being home yet. The later conversation shifts to work topics, specifically performance reviews and company performance.  Here's a summary:\n\n* **Performance Reviews:** The group discusses self and peer reviews, particularly focusing on \"\u51ef\u795e\" (Kai Shen) and \"\u618b\u54e5\" (Bie Ge - likely a manager or senior figure due to being referred to as VP). Kai Shen expresses concern about his \"earn trust\" score being 0, arguing that as a new grad, his performance shouldn't be compared to a VP. Others commend Kai Shen's attendance and activity participation.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1737, "end_char_idx": 3640, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2c5f3b1a-4865-4ab2-937c-745b8897bd74": {"__data__": {"id_": "2c5f3b1a-4865-4ab2-937c-745b8897bd74", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "google_sheets", "document_id": 59, "content_length": 5999, "original_length": 10714, "processed_length": 5999, "compression_ratio": 0.5599215979092775, "preprocessed": true}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "53f554cd-d3b0-4b55-850f-38c435b09a3a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "google_sheets", "document_id": 59, "content_length": 5999, "original_length": 10714, "processed_length": 5999, "compression_ratio": 0.5599215979092775, "preprocessed": true}, "hash": "dac15681e7e0b2e5f6131cacac6f6f9a924891be038ea5fe4b08990cc824c388", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9601b824-22a0-4ba5-a051-58c4d345966a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source": "google_sheets", "document_id": 59, "content_length": 5999, "original_length": 10714, "processed_length": 5999, "compression_ratio": 0.5599215979092775, "preprocessed": true}, "hash": "f23aded3b5a4f7f3ab5866b88d0003585f6337d14eef8adcf48a0ef652188a21", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6b30a3b9-becb-4981-9d68-aefb11c39d85", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "21bcf1ee3b6e002593e4cfd63bac9a7906ef46129fa56a22cba9ceaa6b083e31", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Kai Shen expresses concern about his \"earn trust\" score being 0, arguing that as a new grad, his performance shouldn't be compared to a VP.

They discuss when Biege might return.\n\n* **Career/Work:** There's discussion of Biege's boss's caste (Brahmin), speculation about other members' \"castes,\"  Microsoft layoffs, and Eric mentioning layoffs at his company. Someone jokingly mentions a 100M offer.\n\n* **Leisure:**  Biege played tennis and is now playing a game called \"Expeditionary Force\" (\u8fdc\u5f81\u519b).

It was suggested DoorDash should offer \"bunny\" delivery. This sparked a tangential discussion about American \"bunny\" not being as good.\n* **Travel and activities:**  \"Biege\" was mentioned in relation to travel, including a trip to Hawaii and potentially a fishing trip despite being sick. There's discussion about someone (likely Ma Peng) being in Hawaii with family and comparing it to military training.  Kai Shen mentioned being in Hong Kong.\n* **Meetups:** Eric asked about morning exercise and later about playing basketball.  He and Biege coordinated meeting at Red West for basketball. Eric also asked for food recommendations from T&T Supermarket.  Separately, there was a mention of attending a parade in Bothell.\n\nThis conversation segment is borderline, but given the mix of light planning and more personal updates, it provides some context for the group's interactions.

Eric then implied interest in one of \"\u618b\u54e5's\" possessions (presumably a car, based on the prior 911 reference) but joked that \"\u618b\u54e5\" said his \"appearance wasn't good enough\". \"\u6bb5\u795e\" then joked about Eric knowing that \"\u618b\u54e5\" had built a new airport, to which Eric replied that his imagination wasn't good enough (implying he didn't actually see an airport, continuing the joke).\n\n---\n\nEric is asked where he lives and discusses dinner plans.\n\nSummary:\n\nSomeone asks Eric where he lives (@Eric \u4f60\u4f4f\u54ea\uff1f). Eric explains he's living in a cloud rental in a downtown condo in Bellevue, which he finds somewhat disappointing. He then asks if anyone wants to have dinner. \u618b\u54e5 agrees, and asks where Eric is after saying he's off work. Eric says he's in Bellevue and will get a burger while he waits.  \u51ef\u795e says he can't make it and suggests a weekend meetup, asking when \u618b\u54e5 is leaving. \u618b\u54e5 says next Monday. \u6bb5\u795e suggests a midweek or weekend meetup. Eric confirms a midweek meetup.\n\n---\n\nThe conversation primarily revolves around the group's experience playing a new video game (likely Black Myth: Wukong based on context clues).

Later, the group discusses playing basketball, with \u51ef\u795e lamenting the skill level of pick-up game players compared to \"\u618b\u54e5,\" whom they consider very skilled.

A power outage due to a storm affected some group members.  \u618b\u54e5 lost power and internet at home and work, but has a generator.

They considered having it at \u4f55\u6bd4's house but due to a lack of chairs and \u6bb5\u795e's family commitments on Friday, they decided to go to a restaurant.  \u618b\u54e5 is unavailable on Saturday and Sunday, suggesting they have the barbecue on the current day (presumably Tuesday).  \u6bb5\u795e may not attend the barbecue on Friday due to family dinner plans.  \u51ef\u795e suggested Saturday as an alternative.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 4779, "end_char_idx": 6613, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "15c624cb-875c-4a36-88a4-7c6bba2207bf": {"__data__": {"id_": "15c624cb-875c-4a36-88a4-7c6bba2207bf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "google_sheets", "document_id": 26, "content_length": 6473, "original_length": 10844, "processed_length": 6473, "compression_ratio": 0.5969199557358909, "preprocessed": true}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "db81e76f-2da7-4490-80be-a75e0ca341a2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "google_sheets", "document_id": 26, "content_length": 6473, "original_length": 10844, "processed_length": 6473, "compression_ratio": 0.5969199557358909, "preprocessed": true}, "hash": "b1720cfd942081ae69640623e42f3b54c5bbe51c573dd6586017cc20be934028", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6f08d654-d2f7-4ab8-88e7-caceac48ed09", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d8c7cc958195271e6f05f5d3561827f6ed35780f75cd3da88670eb745601c19b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The topic is dinner plans.\n\nSummary:\n\n\u6bb5\u795e expressed they couldn't make dinner tomorrow night (\"\u660e\u665a\") but could join next time.  \u618b\u54e5 suggested having dinner tonight (\"\u4eca\u665a\") instead.\n\n---\n\nThe main topic is a discussion about the Bilt credit card, its benefits, potential exploits, and associated risks.\n\nSummary:\n\nEric and \u618b\u54e5 are discussing the Bilt credit card. \u618b\u54e5 asks if anyone has used it and mentions it supposedly allows mortgage payments for points.  Eric is skeptical due to the potential reward ($2000/year) and mentions potential loopholes and risks like Wells Fargo (Bilt's partner) losing money and the deal ending.  He also warns about Bilt's poor fraud prevention. Eric advises checking Bilt's website and online forums or consulting with \"romax\" for more information.  He explains how Amex blacklisted him for churning credit card bonuses. \u618b\u54e5 reveals his mortgage is with Wells Fargo and questions using the card. Eric suggests checking online resources.

KaiShen mentions spending $2500 on a December flight with premium select on Delta.  There's a brief, unresolved discussion about when someone is traveling.\n\n**Layoffs:**  ZZN, BieGe, and KaiShen discuss layoffs at Meta/Facebook. Meta is laying off 5% due to performance issues. BieGe explains some employees abused leave policies (FMLA) to delay being fired, but Meta is now closing that loophole.  KaiShen notes Microsoft is becoming more like Amazon in its performance management, pressuring managers to identify low performers.  The group speculates about job security and the difficulty of finding new jobs in the current market. KaiShen expresses interest in moving to Google.\n\nThere's a side conversation about a person (\"B\u795e\") who enjoys playing a character named \"White Tiger\" in a game (likely Dota 2, given the context).

He suggests Wednesday as the best day due to a Friday morning meeting. Later, Kai says his meeting was canceled. Duan asks about it being a team-building event, and Bie raises the concern about parking. Kai clarifies that taking a day off would be best and suggests Wednesday.\n\n**Furniture:** Eric bought a Herman Miller chair and feels overcharged. He's considering returning it and upgrading.  He mentions using Temu and potentially \"all in\" on PDD (Pinduoduo). Jason shares his negative experience with PDD.  Duan asks about Eric's furniture progress and when he'll place an order, to which Eric replies he's finalizing it, but the TikTok ban is making him reconsider.  Duan jokes about Eric and B sharing furniture.\n\n**TikTok Ban:** The conversation turns to the potential TikTok ban in the US.  Eric shares news and images about potential protests. There is a discussion on whether a ban would benefit other platforms like Reels, the political implications, and whether TikTok users would migrate.  Kai suggests buying Meta stock as a hedge. The conversation speculates about what concessions China might offer if the US lifts the ban.  Eric believes the situation will force users to migrate and creators to Reels, even if the user experience isn't comparable.\n\nThis conversation segment contains substantial discussion and should not be filtered out.\n\n---\n\nThe main topic is waiting in a long checkout line, potentially for Zhou Shen concert tickets.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1946, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4ce21430-b955-4d2b-bf55-06410ae7e91a": {"__data__": {"id_": "4ce21430-b955-4d2b-bf55-06410ae7e91a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "google_sheets", "document_id": 28, "content_length": 5356, "original_length": 10530, "processed_length": 5356, "compression_ratio": 0.508641975308642, "preprocessed": true}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "db883008-1f61-401e-8b88-cabba7208151", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "google_sheets", "document_id": 28, "content_length": 5356, "original_length": 10530, "processed_length": 5356, "compression_ratio": 0.508641975308642, "preprocessed": true}, "hash": "c70b8bea6420a5d300ccd4a4c561634523460807d3cec5421e64f64daaced02d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "260f57d0-614b-42ce-995d-e499361cb369", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source": "google_sheets", "document_id": 28, "content_length": 5356, "original_length": 10530, "processed_length": 5356, "compression_ratio": 0.508641975308642, "preprocessed": true}, "hash": "2d7f5140708e3e9bed0ef6a4910faf1755a87a0a3ce88d229a83590d072509db", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2ea80a83-072e-452e-b562-1662cc8c0c5b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7cf0721f7c30b06ae1f225cecb93ce002308e2a382f3f045d9d2b4c9d3584536", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "This conversation segment contains substantial discussion and should not be filtered out.\n\n---\n\nThe main topic is waiting in a long checkout line, potentially for Zhou Shen concert tickets.\n\nSummarized:\n\n@\u96f6\u53f7\u51ef\u7c89-\u5934\u53f7\u618b\u7c89-\u5927\u5e9f\u7269 mentioned a long checkout line. \u6bb5\u795e initially disagreed, saying it was fast, but then agreed it was long.

B\u795e suggested returning to his home country to start a business. Eric commented about a friend at Meta having psychological shadows and advised \"defensive programming\". \u51ef\u795e remarked on \u618b\u54e5's political awareness and sensitivity, suggesting that success would ultimately speak for itself.\n\n---\n\nThe main topic is scheduling a time to use 4 tickets, likely for an event.

His old thermostat only used two wires (R and C), but the new one requires more connections (R, C, Y, W, G).  He connected all five wires to the Ecobee, but it's not detecting the furnace. Yubin suggests checking the furnace connections, pointing out that the old thermostat only needed two wires while the new one requires three for additional voltage, with C being insufficient. Eric checks the furnace and finds two sets of R wires, believing one is for the AC.  He's having trouble figuring out the correct wiring and mentions following a YouTube tutorial.

There is a secondary discussion about playing mahjong.\n\nSummary:\n\nXu Jianing asks when someone (presumably in the group chat) is returning. The person replies that they don't know.\n\nSomeone mentions being sick and others discuss illness, antibiotics, and the frequency of getting sick.\n\nThere is a discussion about playing mahjong, but Xu Jianing says they can't play because their wife wouldn't allow it.  Alternatives like drinking and playing CS are suggested. Xu Jianing clarifies they can go out to play tennis but not for other activities, and mentions their wife doesn't like gifts like Hermes but might like a (presumably Alfa Romeo) Spider.\n\nSomeone else mentions a previous experience with bronchitis and low blood oxygen levels, and later, ZZN asks which hospital they went to.\n\n---\n\nZZN's health and availability for mahjong are the topics.\n\nSummary:\n\n@\u4f59\u9707\u8df5\u8e0f\u5171\u751f asked about ZZN's condition.  ZZN replied that their fever has subsided, they are not hospitalized, but are taking antibiotics at home and under observation.  Later, the group discussed playing mahjong, but noted ZZN is still at home recovering and likely unavailable.\n\n---\n\nThe discussion is about organizing a playdate for adults.

Jason then shifted the conversation to a poker game where he won with quads over a full house.  Others commented on his poker hand, with \u618b\u54e5 mentioning their own rare quads hand.

Others joked about him \"making money\" instead.  When Eric later questioned where the money was, implying a lack of success, the group wondered what he would do.  The conversation shifted to discussing including Eric in later activities (\"\u5546k\" and subsequent events) despite his absence from gaming.  Jason specifically replied to a comment about being included in \"\u5546k\", indicating his interest.\n\n---\n\nThe group is discussing the decline in their basketball skills with age.

He's unsure because the CPU is a 9900 (not the 9800X3D he prefers) and it has a B650 motherboard which others think is not ideal. He's also not thrilled with the 5070ti graphics card, but is tempted by the immediate availability at Costco. A 5080 configuration is available, but with a worse CPU and higher price.  Others discuss the trade-offs of the B650 motherboard (USB 4.0, PCIe5) and the perceived benefits of a pre-built system (claimed quiet operation) versus building one's own.  Final argues pre-built systems offer no performance advantages. The group also briefly discusses the difference between a 5070ti and 5080 graphics card.\n\n---\n\nFinal is having trouble buying a 5090 graphics card, specifically a Founder's Edition (public version), because it's the only one that fits in his case.  Biege suggests he buy a new case, or change his resolution to 800x600 as a workaround.  Others suggest he find a friend at Nvidia to get a Founder's Edition, but Final says they can't find one either. He's considering waiting until he returns to his home country to purchase one from Costco.  Biege states that 5090s are available online, and that his last computer build only cost 1k, while Final points out that graphics cards alone now cost 1k.  The conversation also involves some banter about Biege's 911 and the rising cost of KTV.\n\n---\n\nThe conversation revolves around KTV prices and jokingly escalates to innuendo about other services and locations.  \"Final\" (presumably Xu Jianing) defends themselves against implications of soliciting or providing illicit services.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nFinallz mentioned KTV prices are now 3500.

There's discussion about where to play.\n* **Solutions:** Final suggests playing online and taking \u618b\u54e5's Costco computer.  Jason suggests several online poker platforms (PokerStars, a mini-program, web.wpk.com) and discord.

The conversation shifts to food, with \u9a6c\u68da mentioning McDonald's and \u51ef\u795e talking about eating chicken.  \u9a6c\u68da then tries to meet up with Final, who is at work.  They joke about sniping Final at work. Final then suggests \u9a6c\u68da make videos demonstrating their gaming skills. \u9a6c\u68da deflects, pointing out their lower skill level.

It appears others are acknowledging (\"g\") the initial suggestion.\n\n---\n\n\u9a6c\u68da's inability to access an app and the subsequent discussion about it.\n\nSummary:\n\nMa Peng initially stated he couldn't open a specific app on his phone. Duan Shen responded that he could join anytime. Later, Ma Peng explained he was \"hard controlled\" and couldn't use his phone due to his wife wanting family time, expressing frustration about this. Duan Shen later suggested getting help if needed.  Jason noted Ma Peng's absence made things dull. Kai Shen discussed a game, seemingly unrelated to the app issue, mentioning losing to someone named \"final\" and speculating about the outcome if real money were involved.  Jason's later picture and empty message add no substance to the main discussion.\n\n---\n\nThis conversation revolves around a poker hand and later transitions to setting up a gaming session.\n\nSummary:\n\nJason asks if someone with a 5-6 hand would call (presumably a bet). \u51ef\u795e says he wouldn't, having been burned before by \u618b\u54e5's flush.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1958, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "03397d6b-11d9-4c06-bf3b-c734c5117708": {"__data__": {"id_": "03397d6b-11d9-4c06-bf3b-c734c5117708", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "google_sheets", "document_id": 56, "content_length": 9053, "original_length": 11209, "processed_length": 9053, "compression_ratio": 0.8076545632973503, "preprocessed": true}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "27bc2b48-b792-49a9-ad47-a0f64d520ccb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "google_sheets", "document_id": 56, "content_length": 9053, "original_length": 11209, "processed_length": 9053, "compression_ratio": 0.8076545632973503, "preprocessed": true}, "hash": "9fc6a98ea2917028cbe7caba270210c172140d14167b8994492fbbd73b7ce8a0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "bc40b5d2-e478-4452-8c6a-74d4b19a36e5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source": "google_sheets", "document_id": 56, "content_length": 9053, "original_length": 11209, "processed_length": 9053, "compression_ratio": 0.8076545632973503, "preprocessed": true}, "hash": "8a34704d1dcacd778643c66892972b5cdbc26ccf29dd1212bada3cb7a8b355b5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1ca4ca0a-a927-40e9-be36-c787c712354d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9557be403ae3192356aa7391765ac2a4aa2797421d9db7ea3636f4cec46475a8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Summary:\n\nJason asks if someone with a 5-6 hand would call (presumably a bet). \u51ef\u795e says he wouldn't, having been burned before by \u618b\u54e5's flush. \u9a6c\u68da jokingly says he'd call with anything.  Jason then asks if they would fold with a King-high flush, to which Final replies that folding K-high flush is a way to \"cure addiction\". Final questions why anyone would call with 5-6. Jason reveals the 5-6 hand belonged to \u51ef\u795e, criticizing his play and attributing it to playing with play money.  \u618b\u54e5 claims K-high flush all in is acceptable. Jason notes the 5-6 play scared others off.\n\nLater, Eric asks if anyone at Microsoft wants to play poker after work, mentioning a game organized by \"\u62c9\u6746\u54e5\". ZZN questions Eric's involvement with Microsoft games, to which Eric replies it's organized by \u62c9\u6746\u54e5.  ZZN expresses concern about the Sunday game's difficulty, suggesting Saturday indoor games instead.  Eric is optimistic about improving and suggests Saturday games if a location is found. \u9a6c\u68da expresses disbelief that they could lose any game, and \u6bb5\u795e jokes that only \u8bb8\u516c\u5b50 is unbeatable.\n\nFinally, Jason inquires about the time for playing \"\u5fb7\" (likely Deutschland, a board game) or \"\u67aa\" (likely a shooting game).  \u618b\u54e5 suggests 9 PM on Discord, choosing the game based on the number of participants.  Jason asks about \u618b\u54e5's new computer. \u618b\u54e5 later describes a hand where AA and KK went all-in pre-flop and ran twice, each producing a king. He compares the timing to his own play.  \u9a6c\u68da offers a philosophy on winning at poker, suggesting focusing on probability for long-term gains or luck for immediate wins.\n\n---\n\nThe main topic is coordinating a gathering, likely for an online poker game.\n\nSummary:\n\nA message was sent to everyone to \"go.\"  Several people acknowledged (\"g\", \"go\", \"\u6765\").", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1818, "end_char_idx": 3580, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1ca4ca0a-a927-40e9-be36-c787c712354d": {"__data__": {"id_": "1ca4ca0a-a927-40e9-be36-c787c712354d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "google_sheets", "document_id": 56, "content_length": 9053, "original_length": 11209, "processed_length": 9053, "compression_ratio": 0.8076545632973503, "preprocessed": true}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "27bc2b48-b792-49a9-ad47-a0f64d520ccb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "google_sheets", "document_id": 56, "content_length": 9053, "original_length": 11209, "processed_length": 9053, "compression_ratio": 0.8076545632973503, "preprocessed": true}, "hash": "9fc6a98ea2917028cbe7caba270210c172140d14167b8994492fbbd73b7ce8a0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "03397d6b-11d9-4c06-bf3b-c734c5117708", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source": "google_sheets", "document_id": 56, "content_length": 9053, "original_length": 11209, "processed_length": 9053, "compression_ratio": 0.8076545632973503, "preprocessed": true}, "hash": "2e79bf41662175e0559ca5021c5e2ce0e8e6af83d3ebe2022856e0129685a240", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a03cee11-2225-4195-be66-038d01d9e99a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5a5f84f217f230cdf95a096f5a2b889a5fcd86168f8479e998c767dd532ad725", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "---\n\nThe main topic is coordinating a gathering, likely for an online poker game.\n\nSummary:\n\nA message was sent to everyone to \"go.\"  Several people acknowledged (\"g\", \"go\", \"\u6765\").  \u6bb5\u795e indicated they would be late. \u9a6c\u68da asked where everyone was.

They also questioned the logic of using expensive escort services.  \u618b\u54e5 responded by suggesting that \"poverty limits imagination\" and attributed it to information asymmetry, highlighting the value of their group (having \u9a6c\u68da) in avoiding costly mistakes.  \u618b\u54e5 further illustrated the concept by comparing tipping to opening loot boxes in games\u2014expensive and uncertain\u2014versus directly buying a desired item (a butterfly knife). \u6bb5\u795e countered \u618b\u54e5's analogy, pointing out that loot boxes involve a gambler's mindset, hoping for unlikely positive outcomes despite the odds.\n\n---\n\nSomeone mentioned they were going home and it would take an hour.

Jason questions this. \u51ef\u795e confirms, attributing it to Finallz's poor sniper play and ambition to take someone else's (\u9e1f\u5c45king's) position. Jason mentions their struggles with the AK and later the sniper rifle. \u51ef\u795e suggests competing with \u618b\u54e5 for the sniper role.

Kai Shen defends the combat system and says it might be difficult for Biege initially.  Discussion ensues about \"\u5251\u661f,\" with Kai Shen and others recommending it to Biege.

While the initial exchange about frequency and the age discussion are somewhat related, the final part about the website changes the tone completely. Given the inappropriate turn, it's best to filter this segment out.\n\n**FILTER_OUT**\n\n---\n\nLiu Kun asked where Xiaopangge (presumably a nickname) was. Jason replied that he was at the gym. Biege then asked when he would be finished.\n\nThe main discussion revolves around Xiaopangge's whereabouts and when he will be available.  The summarized conversation is:\n\n**Liu Kun:** Where is Xiaopangge?\n**Jason:** He's at the gym.\n**Biege:** When will he be done? \n\n---\n\nSomeone (@\u4e0d\u53c2\u52a011pm\u4ee5\u540e\u6d3b\u52a8) stated they won't participate in activities after 11 pm.

They further elaborate that they shouldn't \"fail immediately\" like in a shooting game, presumably connecting the cardio to needing stamina or practice for the unnamed activity.  \"\u9a6c\u68da\" is confused and asks \"\u5565\u610f\u601d\" (what does that mean?).  It seems the initial prompt for activity organization was left blank.\n\nSummarized:\n\nA user suggested organizing an activity.  Another user (\"\u6bb5\u795e\") mentioned practicing before a real-world application next week, seemingly related to a previous comment about cardio exercise, and explained they shouldn't fail immediately as if in a shooting game. Another user (\"\u9a6c\u68da\") expressed confusion about the meaning.  The initial suggestion for an activity was empty.\n\n---\n\nThe main topic is planning a basketball game.\n\nSummary:\n\nEric proposes playing basketball. ZZN initially agrees but later goes to the emergency room because their child was sick.  The next day, ZZN asks if the game is still on.  ZZN, Eric, and Kaishen initially plan to play, but Kaishen cancels due to chores before leaving for a trip. Biege also cancels to take their child to Bainbridge. Eric and ZZN decide to shoot hoops together instead. Eric suggests several locations and then confirms he is heading out.\n\n---\n\nThis translates to \"@Not participating in activities after 11 pm\".

The second part seems unrelated and like a separate, casual conversation.  The timestamps suggest a delay between the initial question and ZZN asking \"Where did you go?\".

Duan Shen mentioned feeling like their four cards were beat by a two-outer. Bie Ge commented that KK couldn't go all in but 99 could, aiming to slow play for value and capitalize on a potential straight flush. Kai Shen pointed out this analysis is hindsight-biased, as it relies on knowing the 7 and 8 of hearts.  Kai Shen also questioned the pre-flop pot size of 12k, suggesting it's too low and that KK and 99 should have 3-bet pre-flop in a 1000/2000 blind game. Kai Shen analyzed 99's perspective, stating they would primarily consider AA, KK, or AK, and aim to extract value from those hands, not worrying much about a straight flush draw. Duan Shen jokingly expressed feeling intimidated by the group's poker knowledge. Kai Shen clarified he's a beginner.  The conversation then shifts to when Kai Shen is returning home (August).\n\n---\n\nDuan Shen told Jason to stop what he was doing and register a WeChat account to make a purchase (presumably for the \"final\" mentioned).

Jason seems to agree (\"\u6709\u7684\") and then makes derogatory comments about someone, seemingly unrelated to the initial topic. \u618b\u54e5 doesn't contribute anything substantial.\n\nSince the core discussion about flaking is overshadowed by off-topic insults and meaningless acknowledgments, the meaningful conversation is minimal. Thus, the response is:\n\nFILTER_OUT\n\n---\n\nJason initially declines an invitation due to not being home yet. The later conversation shifts to work topics, specifically performance reviews and company performance.  Here's a summary:\n\n* **Performance Reviews:** The group discusses self and peer reviews, particularly focusing on \"\u51ef\u795e\" (Kai Shen) and \"\u618b\u54e5\" (Bie Ge - likely a manager or senior figure due to being referred to as VP). Kai Shen expresses concern about his \"earn trust\" score being 0, arguing that as a new grad, his performance shouldn't be compared to a VP.

Final jokingly reduces AI's significance, comparing it to a simple string operation (`String.substring()`).\n\n---\n\nEric is suggesting to the person who mentioned joining OpenAI that they should join first and then recruit Eric next year.

Many members express they are unavailable. They discuss when Biege might return.\n\n* **Career/Work:** There's discussion of Biege's boss's caste (Brahmin), speculation about other members' \"castes,\"  Microsoft layoffs, and Eric mentioning layoffs at his company. Someone jokingly mentions a 100M offer.\n\n* **Leisure:**  Biege played tennis and is now playing a game called \"Expeditionary Force\" (\u8fdc\u5f81\u519b).

It was suggested DoorDash should offer \"bunny\" delivery. This sparked a tangential discussion about American \"bunny\" not being as good.\n* **Travel and activities:**  \"Biege\" was mentioned in relation to travel, including a trip to Hawaii and potentially a fishing trip despite being sick. There's discussion about someone (likely Ma Peng) being in Hawaii with family and comparing it to military training.  Kai Shen mentioned being in Hong Kong.\n* **Meetups:** Eric asked about morning exercise and later about playing basketball.  He and Biege coordinated meeting at Red West for basketball. Eric also asked for food recommendations from T&T Supermarket.  Separately, there was a mention of attending a parade in Bothell.\n\nThis conversation segment is borderline, but given the mix of light planning and more personal updates, it provides some context for the group's interactions.

He plans to feed it WeChat chat data.  His next project is a poker AI that the group can play against.  There was a brief discussion about screen capture protection on their poker platform (wpk) and how Biege could overcome it.  Others suggested alternative AI projects like CS.  Biege is actively researching how to export the chat data, and MaPeng offered assistance, mentioning he'd done it before (possibly with paid software he's still subscribed to).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3650, "end_char_idx": 5042, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}}
